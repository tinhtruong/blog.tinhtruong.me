      <description>In my recent project, I have a need to monitor a directory for changes such as a new file created, modified or deleted. Surprisingly, JDK (up to JDK 6) does not have APIs to do that! JDK 7 does support it out of the box but I am stuck with the version 6.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just joined a project as a freelancer to customize a commercial e-commerce solution (so let called it EP). OOTB, the email sending of EP does not support authentication, which is a weird thing for such a cool product like that.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to ArchLinux from Fedora a couple of months ago and I really miss the mirror of Fedora on FPT (my current ISP). A few days ago, I wrote an email to ask the FPT mirrors admin to add a mirror for ArchLinux to their mirror systems. Here is what I wrote (in Vietnamese):
 Gởi Admin mirror của FPT.
Arch Linux là một distro khá phổ biến hiện nay, ArchLinux đang đứng trong top 20 distro phổ biến theo Distrowatch.</description>
